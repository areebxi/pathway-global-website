        <span class="heading">OVERVIEW</span><br><br>
            <span class="paragraph">The term 'audit' comes from the Latin word 'audire' - which literally means 'to hear'.
                In ancient times, if fraud is being suspected within a business company, the owner of the company 
                will hire an independent person who will evaluate the accounts and listen to the explanations provided 
                for by the personnel who is responsible for maintaining the funds and accounts. During the time,
                the audit is a process of finding out whether the receipts and payments were properly accounted for or otherwise.</span>

        <span class="heading">AUDITING AS DEFINED</span><br><br>
            <span class="paragraph">The most accurate definition of 'auditing' is rather difficult to provide. Some definitions by 
                renowned authors are given in the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Montgomery, a popular author, defined 'auditing' as the organized evaluation of books and records of a 
                        given company or organization to determine or verify and report the facts about its financial status and operation.</li>
                    <li>Lawrence R. Dicksee stated that 'auditing' is the process of evaluating accounting records done with a purpose of 
                        establishing whether the transactions were correct and complete to which they all relate. In some cases, it is necessary
                        to verify whether the transactions done were supported by the proper authority.</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, R. K. Mautz stated that 'auditing' deals with the confirmation of the accuracy and reliability
                        as well as correctness of accounting data including the reports and accounting statements.</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Given by various definitions above, it is necessary for auditors to evaluate various books and accounts as well as other related
                documents to establish their accuracy and authenticity for reporting purposes about the financial status of the company.</span>
            </span>

        <br><br><hr><br>

        <span class="heading">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING</span><br><br>
        <span class="paragraph">

            Accounting has a role of recording transactions in book of accounts, preparing trading and profit and loss account 
            and balance sheet and extraction of trial balance.<br><br>

            Auditing, on the other hand, is the evaluation of books of account and examining the financial statements with a purpose
            of verifying the authentic and fair position and operation results. It is a process of dealing with detailed evaluation
            of the complete accounting records however it does not include account preparation.<br><br>

            If the auditor will be asked to prepare the books of accounts and extract trial balance as well as the balance sheet
            and profit and loss account, he will be doing not his job as an auditor but as an accountant. The scope of auditing
            does not include preparation of account. An auditor is an appointed and independent authority that will thoroughly
            evaluate whether the balance sheet and profit and loss account were prepared properly and disclose the true and fair
            view of the affairs and results of operation of the company to the interested parties.<br><br>

            However, it is not possible to audit documents prior to their existence. The only time that the auditor comes in to perform
             his job is when the accountant has completed drawing up the documents needed.</span>
