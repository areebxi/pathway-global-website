        <span class="heading">2 - HIRING OF STAFF:</span><br><br>
        <span class="paragraph">How much time, effort and investment do you put into hiring a person into a role, 
            only to find after a few months they are not suitable or they decide to leave you? Employing people 
            can be a daunting and challenging experience. RMC Consultants can help you plan your entire employee cycle. 
            We can help align or prepare a people strategy linked to your organizations overall business plan and goals.

            are mandatory and ensure the employee fully understands their role and what is expected from them.</span><br><br>
         
        <span class="heading">3 - EMPLOYMENT AND PAKISTAN LABOUR LAW:</span><br><br>
        <span class="paragraph">Are you up-to date with the ever changing employment regulations and most importantly 
            do you understand the consequences of not complying with such? Whether you're a small company with only a 
            handful of employees or a global business employing thousands, keeping up with the legislation is a headache. 
            On-compliance costs in terms of both time and money. But whilst we aim to ensure compliance with the ever 
            changing UAE employment legislation, we also seek the most practical solutions to ensure excellent employee

            letters linking to any of the policies such as first written warning, probation extension, dismissal letter etc or 
            any HR template which you require. We further are at hand to communicate and train your employees on policies and 
            practices so everyone fully understands the importance of such. Otherwise they can just be a document sat on a

            an overworked HR team supporting multiple activities, may benefit from streamlining HR processes. We map out and 
            document HR processes, simplify them and make them more user friendly for employees. For clients without any HR 
            processes in place we create the ones that will make life easier, and help line managers and employees to 
            understand what they need to do too.</span><br><br>
